📊 Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

SQL + Tableau Project

🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn behavior in the telecom domain, using personally collected data from a local Wi-Fi provider. Due to data privacy restrictions, the provider shared usage, billing, and complaint data for 10 anonymized customers — with names excluded.

Using this data, I created a custom SQL schema to simulate a real-world churn environment and applied analytical queries to uncover:

Which customers are at risk

What behavioral patterns lead to churn

How billing failures and support issues affect retention

The results were visualized using Tableau, with actionable KPIs and interactive dashboards designed to support business decision-making.


📁 Dataset

customers: customer details and churn status

usage: monthly data, call, and SMS usage

billing: bill amount and payment status

customer_support: support tickets and resolution time

📌 All tables were manually created using SQL scripts.
